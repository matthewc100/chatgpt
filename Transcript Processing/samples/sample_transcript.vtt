1
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.080
Evan Bristow: Hmm!

2
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.259
Evan Bristow: Oh my!

3
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:32.590
Evan Bristow: Tired!

4
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.130
Evan Woollacott: Oh, heaven!

5
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.220
Evan Bristow: Hello, Evan!

6
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.159
Evan Woollacott: Long time. No talk how you been.

7
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.519
Evan Bristow: I'm okay. How about yourself?

8
00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:20.859
Evan Woollacott: Also alright.

9
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520
Evan Bristow: Good, good.

10
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.340
Evan Woollacott: Just get a moment for Matt to join. He should be here to the meeting.

11
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.400
Matt Coblentz: Sorry I'm late, gents.

12
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.659
Evan Bristow: No worries.

13
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.690
Matt Coblentz: I hope everything is going well for you out there in Indianapolis.

14
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.580
Evan Bristow: Indianapolis, I mean.

15
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.670
Evan Bristow: It's it is what it is, and it's not what it's not so.

16
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.290
Matt Coblentz: It's not what it's not.

17
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.209
Matt Coblentz: How are the kids? How the family? Let's check in real quick.

18
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.340
Evan Bristow: Kids are good. Family's fine going on vacation next week.

19
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:35.990
Evan Bristow: It goes.

20
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.350
Matt Coblentz: Where are you going.

21
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.539
Evan Bristow: Arizona onto my

22
00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:44.859
Evan Bristow: place where my wife went to grad school, go visit there for like a day, and then

23
00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:48.749
Evan Bristow: part around sea desert stuff, I guess.

24
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:55.619
Matt Coblentz: All good, clean, excellent stuff. So if you're in Phoenix

25
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:08.690
Matt Coblentz: or Scottsdale, then I will recommend you. Drive about 45 min north to Cave Creek, rent one of those Atv rentals and go drive around in the National Park for a half a day. It's dusty fun.

26
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.010
Evan Bristow: Interesting.

27
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:19.159
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, you get to drive around old Dry Creek beds and stuff like this and make your way around. And it's 1 of those you strap the kids in the back.

28
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.870
Matt Coblentz: put yourself and Mom in the front seat and just

29
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.549
Matt Coblentz: have at it. There's no windshield, so be prepared for bugs and dust in your grill.

30
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.970
Evan Bristow: Interesting. All right. Well.

31
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.310
Matt Coblentz: I'm gonna recommend that and if you're really curious, I will send you the link.

32
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.509
Evan Bristow: I don't know that my wife is that adventurous.

33
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.579
Matt Coblentz: Hard drive, but you never know. There you have it.

34
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:54.039
Matt Coblentz: okay. So the reason I called this meeting to order was because Evan and I continually are digging into

35
00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:07.810
Matt Coblentz: the tableau, dashboard, and stuff like this, looking at win loss. And, by the way, we love the dashboard. But every time they ask for something that dashboard doesn't exactly fulfill. We're like struggling to figure out how exactly we we pull that out. So.

36
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.880
Evan Bristow: Just ask me. I do more than dashboards, you know.

37
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.959
Matt Coblentz: I know right. But the other thing is, I was wondering.

38
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:23.339
Matt Coblentz: is everything we need in the sales pipeline. 3 data set. Or should I understand that there's extra qualifications that you guys

39
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.760
Matt Coblentz: do to make the dashboard run with some sort of excel spreadsheet. So we were wondering

40
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.249
Matt Coblentz: if we could. If that's the case, then can you just

41
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.540
Matt Coblentz: publish us a data set that we could always fish in when we can't get what we need.

42
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.450
Matt Coblentz: Did that make sense.

43
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:40.860
Evan Bristow: Sort of

44
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.090
Evan Bristow: Excuse me.

45
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:46.790
Matt Coblentz: Sunthide.

46
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.840
Evan Bristow: It depends. I mean, everything that you would need in the dashboard is in our.

47
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.390
Matt Coblentz: Hold on!

48
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.130
Matt Coblentz: Pipeline, 3 pipe, either sp. 3 or one of the other views.

49
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:10.490
Evan Bristow: Except for the competitive deal reclassification thing. That's that's inside the tablet.

50
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.540
Evan Bristow: Yeah, that's the

51
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:19.300
Evan Bristow: that's in tableau itself. Again, it's just based off of rules. And so like, literally, it's it's just written in

52
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.070
Evan Bristow: What is it? Tableau's vision?

53
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.400
Evan Bristow: Biz, sequel, or whatever they call it?

54
00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:30.679
Evan Bristow: Rather than sequel. Again, it's you could literally

55
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.340
Evan Bristow: I could. I could. I could get copy the formula and give it to you, and you could probably spend about

56
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.760
Evan Bristow: 10 min, and just convert it into sequel, and then.

57
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.399
Matt Coblentz: Well, that would work too.

58
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.290
Evan Bristow: Yeah, so if if that works cool.

59
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.440
Matt Coblentz: That could work

60
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.348
Matt Coblentz: for us, because that way, then we could say, Look, we're using the Rev. Ops data set according to the rules.

61
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.440
Matt Coblentz: But when Az comes up with some extra slice that just isn't there, we're like.

62
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.899
Evan Bristow: Yeah, now, what do we do? And the other nice thing actually is having that.

63
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.740
Matt Coblentz: In sales.

64
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.740
Matt Coblentz: Snowflake allows us then to grab Tyler or Connor's data set on partnership

65
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.419
Matt Coblentz: and do a join. That is way faster, easier. There.

66
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.310
Evan Bristow: That's that is very descriptive.

67
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.840
Matt Coblentz: They don't use the same data set for the partner.

68
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.320
Evan Bristow: Partnership. You said part.

69
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.390
Matt Coblentz: Partnership. Yes.

70
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.490
Matt Coblentz: Yeah. Well.

71
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.910
Evan Woollacott: Partner, bookings.

72
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.700
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, like, oh, okay, how much of the partners influence our bookings and all all of that, and what

73
00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:49.989
Matt Coblentz: and where, and you know. And then Don Feldman says, Oh, no, Tsd's and do this, and Tyler and Connor look at me like dude. Just use the damn dashboard because you'll never you can't repeat that logic.

74
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.910
Matt Coblentz: and I'm hoping there's no logic in the dashboard that it's all in some other data set. They have.

75
00:12:56.482 --> 00:13:02.020
Evan Bristow: Most of what Connor has is literally just another

76
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:08.879
Evan Bristow: append from something else. I would almost tell you to go to the go to the data set that

77
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:22.260
Evan Bristow: populates the dashboard. But except for the problem is, we do some sausage making in there to get targets and stuff. So they're fake rows of data that have targets for tableau display purposes. So I don't want you to accidentally get goofed up by anything.

78
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.881
Evan Bristow: Let me see if it's gonna let me connect to tableau server here and

79
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.950
Evan Bristow: and then I will see if I can actually copy that.

80
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.670
Evan Bristow: It says I'm signed in what the poo.

81
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.970
Matt Coblentz: Well, there you go right.

82
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.550
Evan Bristow: Odd it was telling me I couldn't publish this.

83
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:53.053
Matt Coblentz: There are days when I actually take it at its face value. I'm like, Oh, sorry I boss. I just couldn't do any work today.

84
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.850
Evan Bristow: Nope, it's done sorry, Computer said. No.

85
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.229
Matt Coblentz: Computer said, no, sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that

86
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.989
Matt Coblentz: partnership, you know. There you go.

87
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.940
Evan Bristow: Bullcott probably doesn't give. Get that reference.

88
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.619
Evan Bristow: Oh, oh, we do.

89
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.040
Evan Bristow: Youngins.

90
00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:18.049
Evan Bristow: Alright, it is downloading. Give me a hot minute.

91
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.450
Evan Bristow: But one other thing that this is another thing. They're tossing around

92
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.430
Evan Bristow: in terms of L to C.

93
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.800
Matt Coblentz: And it.

94
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.319
Evan Bristow: Kind of got me thinking. So

95
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.900
Evan Bristow: in l 2 c. Design, we've got the thing where an ae can't switch from a primary quote to a non primary quote

96
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.099
Evan Bristow: or not, they can't switch from

97
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.259
Evan Bristow: a primary quote to a non-approved secondary.

98
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:50.230
Evan Bristow: So that's gonna take care of a lot of the switching quotes to tank the

99
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.930
Evan Bristow: value of an opportunity when it's near the end.

100
00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:02.050
Evan Bristow: Accidentally, there could still be some intentional ways of doing that

101
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.589
Evan Bristow: in L. 2 C. There's going to be this thing called a quote recall.

102
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.169
Evan Bristow: So if it's been approved, they can recall the quote and make changes to it, and then resubmit it.

103
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.770
Matt Coblentz: But then it still has to go through the deal desk process correct.

104
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.730
Evan Bristow: Yes, depending on.

105
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.969
Matt Coblentz: Once it's recalled.

106
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.400
Evan Bristow: It correct, but

107
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:30.100
Evan Bristow: it depends on the change, on whether or not it goes through automatic approvals versus versus a deal review. So like, if they just change something about like

108
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.800
Evan Bristow: some non recurring part or something like that, that is not

109
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:42.140
Evan Bristow: yeah, or Zip, zip code, or something like that, where it doesn't have to go back to all these checks. It'll just go through automatic approvals, and it'll just it'll go

110
00:15:42.688 --> 00:15:51.159
Evan Bristow: versus if they're changing gross acv drastically. And I I'm pretty sure there's some kind of rules like 10%. Blah blah. I don't

111
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:57.069
Evan Bristow: as long as it'll go outside of bounds it'll just go long and short is

112
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.589
Evan Bristow: technically there is a way for an ae to take the deal.

113
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.759
Evan Bristow: They could withdraw the deal and delete all the delete all the line items out of it.

114
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.150
Evan Bristow: I don't know how frequent that is gonna occur.

115
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.959
Evan Bristow: but what we had talked about doing, or at least the the solve for that on our side.

116
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:23.860
Evan Bristow: is going to be the last best quote before close lost.

117
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.600
Evan Bristow: So I don't know that we can do it in classic because classic.

118
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.950
Evan Bristow: But in l. 2 C. Since things will be cleaner.

119
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.299
Evan Bristow: we should be able to just look through the stage history

120
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.769
Evan Bristow: and find the last time that it had an approved quote and pull the gross acb at that point in time.

121
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.000
Matt Coblentz: Okay.

122
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.260
Evan Bristow: So.

123
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.669
Matt Coblentz: If it had an approved quote. Yeah.

124
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.440
Evan Bristow: Yes, yeah, if it had an approved quote.

125
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.630
Evan Bristow: So that's 1 thing that we're contemplating doing, which would impact win rates potential.

126
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:04.059
Matt Coblentz: Win rates. I don't know. I mean, we win when we win. We calculate win rates off a stage.

127
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.320
Matt Coblentz: I mean loss rates, sure

128
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.319
Matt Coblentz: or total. Maybe maybe you're also talking about the total population value. Right? Yeah, okay.

129
00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:16.560
Evan Woollacott: Would change. Yeah.

130
00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.949
Evan Bristow: Yeah, yeah, potentially size in your denominator. Yeah.

131
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.170
Matt Coblentz: Okay.

132
00:17:21.835 --> 00:17:27.509
Evan Bristow: Again. We're not going to be an L. 2 C. Until at the minimum February.

133
00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:28.799
Evan Bristow: So.

134
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.690
Matt Coblentz: Jeez! That's.

135
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.220
Evan Bristow: Nothing impacting there.

136
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.779
Evan Bristow: But that being said, I was kind of toying with the idea

137
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:44.790
Evan Bristow: of seeing if we could build something like that now and

138
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.989
Evan Bristow: see what you guys thought of it.

139
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.019
Matt Coblentz: I don't see any reason why we couldn't. Do

140
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.849
Matt Coblentz: you know a general analysis that says, you know, for those losses where the last quote.

141
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.130
Matt Coblentz: doesn't you know, wasn't approved right? We just go pull the value of the approved quote. I mean.

142
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:11.124
Matt Coblentz: it's a bit of a complicated query. But you know we could do it with a couple of. I bet I could do it with 3 collections, but that's because I'm lazy.

143
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.410
Evan Bristow: Because you can have. You can have multiple approved quotes on and off, too.

144
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.389
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, but you only want the last one.

145
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.539
Evan Bristow: The last one might not have been the primary.

146
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.404
Matt Coblentz: I don't give a shit.

147
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:24.550
Matt Coblentz: I do.

148
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.210
Matt Coblentz: Don't know.

149
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.889
Evan Bristow: Anyway, long, long, and

150
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.359
Evan Bristow: long, and short, is like you. You could pretty easily write a seque, write a SQL. Statement.

151
00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:36.200
Evan Bristow: Looking at.

152
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.129
Matt Coblentz: I mean, that seems like, so you're just trying to estimate the impact of like, how different that is. Okay.

153
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:51.639
Evan Bristow: Yeah, you can use sales. Pipeline history. 3. So like in sales. Pipeline history. 3. Just fine, you know, for everything that doesn't have an approved quote at the end

154
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.163
Evan Bristow: find the Max date of the last primary last.

155
00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.830
Matt Coblentz: Approved, quote.

156
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.550
Evan Bristow: Approve.

157
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:06.719
Evan Bristow: Quote OP. And pull the gross A/C like it's 2, 3, 4 lines of code. Again.

158
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:13.280
Evan Bristow: I know that there's historically been a lot of shenanigans like that that's occurred.

159
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.270
Evan Bristow: I just don't know the size or something.

160
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:23.070
Matt Coblentz: I, you know I don't have the feeling that that occurs all I mean. I don't know why they would bother. Seems like an awful lot of work to hide your

161
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.560
Matt Coblentz: failure. But.

162
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:43.520
Evan Bristow: Well see that that's the thing is, we don't know. All we know is the quote changed. We don't know if they were trying to just oh, I still, I think I got a fighting chance. I'm gonna make a new quote. I'm gonna start off and I'm gonna build it up and go back to the customer. And maybe while they click on new and switch the primary, they get a phone call or an email that says, Sorry.

163
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.739
Evan Bristow: you know you've been great, but we should just be friends.

164
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.356
Matt Coblentz: You know.

165
00:19:50.800 --> 00:20:00.569
Matt Coblentz: I bet this only occurs for people that are no longer with Genesis, because my guess is, you have that kind of behavior often enough. Your boss is going to be like, I don't need your. I don't need your crap anymore.

166
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.450
Evan Bristow: Potentially, but.

167
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:09.799
Matt Coblentz: You know, but the good ones that stick around probably don't do that, so I don't know. But I'm willing to bet

168
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:15.800
Matt Coblentz: for fun that you won't find a significant number of those.

169
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.370
Evan Bristow: The number. The number is not the issue.

170
00:20:20.298 --> 00:20:22.689
Matt Coblentz: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

171
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.270
Evan Bristow: It's the size.

172
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.600
Matt Coblentz: Can't. I can't see it being.

173
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.590
Matt Coblentz: I must be a really trusting guy. I just don't.

174
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.180
Evan Bristow: God, no.

175
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.129
Matt Coblentz: A big impact.

176
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:43.539
Evan Bristow: Yeah, there was like at the at the end of the year. What was it 2 years ago? Which is why we put this requirement in Ltc.

177
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.749
Evan Bristow: It's been that Long Len came to me, and he's like

178
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:53.850
Evan Bristow: what happened to these these deals in my in my loss report. I expected to see these 3 or 4

179
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.740
Evan Bristow: 1 million 2 million dollar deals. They're nowhere to be found like they're not at the top of the list

180
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:04.379
Evan Bristow: like well, they're not. They don't have that value anymore. Then, lo and behold!

181
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.810
Evan Bristow: Like, you know, it's like the

182
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.340
Evan Bristow: 2 million 3 million dollar deals where this shit's happening is, they're tanking the value.

183
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.649
Evan Bristow: whatever reason we don't know

184
00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:22.029
Evan Bristow: cause. Maybe there's some vestiges from places they used to work where they would get dinged on win rates.

185
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.100
Evan Bristow: anyway.

186
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.809
Evan Bristow: But it's a small number of deals, but like those are the ones that

187
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.245
Evan Bristow: when you're talking about enter enterprise space and looking at like us versus a nicer

188
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.590
Evan Bristow: Whatever the else we compete with for enterprise space, the

189
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:47.040
Evan Bristow: the valid deals are so few that we don't want those to give us, false false hope, right.

190
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.469
Matt Coblentz: Now. The real other half of that question, I suppose, is, how many times does that happen with a partner? Not that

191
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.080
Matt Coblentz: I could see partners knocking around with things because they don't know. So.

192
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.540
Evan Bristow: Partners. Currently, partners do not quote

193
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.420
Evan Bristow: eighties to the quoting, okay in the future. Yeah.

194
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.540
Evan Bristow: But again, that's why.

195
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.139
Matt Coblentz: Resellers resellers. We don't have.

196
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.090
Evan Bristow: The only

197
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:20.169
Evan Bristow: selecting. Yep, they they bring it to an ae. The ae quotes it out for him, sends them the quote.

198
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.279
Matt Coblentz: Well, there's something I didn't know. Yeah.

199
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.770
Matt Coblentz: well, I'm still a trusting guy. I still think it's gonna be less than 10%.

200
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.279
Evan Bristow: Oh, yeah, it'll be less than 10%. But it'll be like

201
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.280
Evan Bristow: a a few number of big Ops where it's

202
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.819
Evan Bristow: meeting. Anyway. I don't want to talk here.

203
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:49.080
Matt Coblentz: Real question is, does it occur in the same same teams? Same place, you know.

204
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.149
Matt Coblentz: That's what I'd be more interested in that.

205
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.560
Evan Bristow: Yeah, that I have not. I have not checked.

206
00:22:54.190 --> 00:23:00.719
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, I'm gonna guess that it's like, or permissive teams.

207
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.720
Matt Coblentz: And we could shut that down fast enough with a course corrective conversation.

208
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.260
Evan Bristow: Yeah.

209
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:15.039
Evan Bristow: yep. And that's why we we created a dashboard that shows changes to opportunities week over week. And that was one of the things that it highlights is.

210
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.590
Evan Bristow: you know. Here's any of your significant value. Changes on your opportunities.

211
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.839
Evan Bristow: Did it change my part of the guy.

212
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.460
Matt Coblentz: Clean your room set, or is that another dashboard.

213
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.679
Evan Bristow: It's another one, it is

214
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.789
Matt Coblentz: Well, that would be fun to look at, wouldn't it?

215
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.448
Evan Bristow: Let's see where where it was. What the hell did I call it?

216
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.340
Evan Bristow: I don't remember. Let me look

217
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.359
Evan Bristow: because I've I've since given it to Connor for maintenance.

218
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.530
Matt Coblentz: Okay.

219
00:23:45.273 --> 00:23:46.760
Evan Bristow: Blah, blah!

220
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.550
Evan Bristow: Pipeline changes.

221
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.820
Evan Bristow: Yeah, this guy right here, chat.

222
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.546
Matt Coblentz: Got it.

223
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:14.170
Matt Coblentz: Okay? And let's go back to your other thing. Hot minute is up.

224
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.239
Matt Coblentz: Whoops signed in. Oh, my goodness!

225
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.029
Matt Coblentz: Do you think tableau lets you in.

226
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.259
Evan Bristow: I can just show it to you.

227
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.500
Matt Coblentz: You can do that too.

228
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.750
Evan Bristow: Yeah, basically, waterfall. So you put your 2 dates in.

229
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.489
Evan Bristow: or it just it defaults to a week ago. So show me what the differences are between those.

230
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:44.409
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, no pipeline change. Yeah. No. I was talking about the rules for the competitive part thing.

231
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.530
Evan Bristow: Oh, that's.

232
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.220
Matt Coblentz: Bad thing.

233
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.070
Evan Bristow: That thing.

234
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.800
Evan Bristow: Oh, where is it?

235
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.400
Evan Bristow: Here? Yes.

236
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.000
Evan Bristow: here we go.

237
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.450
Matt Coblentz: Oh, my!

238
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.410
Evan Bristow: What did I call competitive? Versus? No.

239
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.500
Matt Coblentz: Hot, digging.

240
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.879
Evan Bristow: Alright, Mister Matt, see if I can find you, Matt.

241
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.020
Evan Bristow: See.

242
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.310
Evan Bristow: I'll paste this, and it does use.

243
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.339
Evan Bristow: So then it defaults to this competitive versus non competitive.

244
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.920
Evan Bristow: If it's not one of these other things.

245
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.260
Matt Coblentz: It's a case statement. Okay.

246
00:25:53.410 --> 00:26:03.390
Evan Bristow: And then this is basically the noncompetitives are legacy cleanup, reduced by any slash, no action taken.

247
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.890
Matt Coblentz: Okay.

248
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.819
Evan Bristow: I don't know if you want to screen crap, screen, crap that.

249
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:11.179
Matt Coblentz: I'm recording it so.

250
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.039
Evan Bristow: Oh, you are okay. There you go.

251
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.890
Matt Coblentz: Yeah.

252
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.230
Evan Bristow: And then the competitiveness.

253
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.190
Matt Coblentz: Apparently I have it on by default, so I'll just leave it.

254
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.829
Evan Bristow: Creepy. Hope you don't have AI on by default.

255
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.800
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, well, sometimes.

256
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.200
Evan Bristow: Yeah.

257
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.120
Matt Coblentz: I don't know.

258
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.830
Evan Bristow: It's how they get you, anyway.

259
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.410
Matt Coblentz: Great.

260
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.550
Evan Bristow: Well, you get that now.

261
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.870
Matt Coblentz: I got that.

262
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.799
Evan Bristow: So the other thing is, did you hear the news about that AI Company out of India?

263
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.819
Evan Bristow: The AI App Making Company.

264
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.669
Matt Coblentz: Oh, cool. Nope.

265
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.650
Evan Bristow: So so apparently you'd submit this thing to AI, and it would the AI would make you an app.

266
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.290
Evan Bristow: turns out.

267
00:26:48.886 --> 00:26:49.340
Evan Woollacott: There's no.

268
00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.529
Evan Bristow: There's no AI. There's 600 Indians sitting in a in a warehouse somewhere.

269
00:26:54.896 --> 00:26:55.290
Evan Woollacott: You know.

270
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.819
Evan Bristow: These apps for you.

271
00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.940
Evan Woollacott: Didn't Microsoft just spend 1.5 billion.

272
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.400
Evan Bristow: Yeah. And they invested like 1.5 billion dollars in it.

273
00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.690
Evan Woollacott: Oops!

274
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.339
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, where's your due diligence there? But you didn't even go to visit.

275
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.850
Evan Bristow: Well, then, they they find, like they said, that their revenue was something like, you know.

276
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.380
Evan Bristow: 200 million dollars, or something like that last quarter, and I had like 10 million dollars in revenue.

277
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.830
Evan Bristow: and it's like somebody somebody got paid.

278
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.051
Matt Coblentz: Somebody made a lot of money.

279
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.520
Matt Coblentz: but it made a lot. Yeah.

280
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.640
Matt Coblentz: Now.

281
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.190
Evan Bristow: Anyway.

282
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:39.420
Matt Coblentz: Somebody and somebody else should stop making a lot of money. You you're the weakest link. You're gone.

283
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.090
Evan Bristow: Alright. You need anything else from me, my friend.

284
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.130
Matt Coblentz: No, sir.

285
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:52.467
Matt Coblentz: I think we have enough to be successful and cause additional trouble as needed. You can certainly blame us all the time.

286
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.889
Matt Coblentz: and

287
00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:02.369
Matt Coblentz: I will probably start. I know I have to go off to Ccw. But if I get to it this week I may even start digging into a whole

288
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.230
Matt Coblentz: last best quote question.

289
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.779
Evan Bristow: If you got the time. No other stuff too.

290
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.769
Matt Coblentz: I think it's gonna be more team related than it's gonna be. I mean.

291
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.699
Matt Coblentz: I think there were going to be egregious areas. And I think we're gonna find the correlation is related to the manager.

292
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.930
Evan Bristow: I'd be interested to know what you find.

293
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.210
Evan Bristow: Okay. Alright.

294
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.199
Matt Coblentz: I will be able to publish, and then you can actually check the logic.

295
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.360
Evan Bristow: Cheers my friends.

296
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.230
Evan Woollacott: Thank you.

297
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.140
Evan Bristow: Always.

298
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.810
Matt Coblentz: Thanks.

299
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.380
Matt Coblentz: All right. Chief.

300
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.620
Evan Woollacott: Progress.

301
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:51.780
Matt Coblentz: Indeed, we can actually duplicate then everything that he's got in this little tableau anytime you need to do

302
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.410
Matt Coblentz: shit.

303
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.929
Matt Coblentz: That doesn't.

304
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.799
Evan Woollacott: That's the that is the hope.

305
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.029
Matt Coblentz: Come piece of cake.

306
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.741
Matt Coblentz: Don't think if he can send it to me by chat. It ain't that big

307
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.680
Evan Woollacott: No, I've seen the logic. It's not that crazy.

308
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.450
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, Evan Bristow.

309
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.900
Matt Coblentz: No, it's a simple case statement.

310
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.979
Matt Coblentz: He's just doing groupings piece of cake.

311
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.770
Matt Coblentz: Alrighty. Then

312
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:33.780
Matt Coblentz: we will be able to make noise.

313
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.040
Evan Woollacott: We like to be able to do.

314
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.970
Matt Coblentz: Yeah.

315
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:44.360
Matt Coblentz: Well, the real thing. What I was originally thinking was, Wow, we could just hook, excel up to Snowflake. There's a connector for that, but

316
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:52.120
Matt Coblentz: it's painfully slow, and probably not worth it. You would pull your hair out, strand by strand.

317
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.400
Evan Woollacott: Believable.

318
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.159
Matt Coblentz: It's awful!

319
00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:02.390
Matt Coblentz: I tried it, and I'm like, Oh, my God! I tried to load a million rows, and I'm like, Stop! I don't want this.

320
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.699
Matt Coblentz: I had to crash, excel, to make it work.

321
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.570
Matt Coblentz: Anything else I can do for you.

322
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.196
Evan Woollacott: I don't think so.

323
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.279
Matt Coblentz: Do we know what we need to do for a Vanessa cause? I sure don't. But.

324
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.630
Evan Woollacott: So we're.

325
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.370
Matt Coblentz: You have clues to the plan.

326
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:30.336
Evan Woollacott: I have some clues. I can pop it up real quick.

327
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.920
Matt Coblentz: Did you get a response back from Az and team.

328
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.260
Evan Woollacott: We had a meeting today, too, which was helpful.

329
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.144
Evan Woollacott: But basically what we're gonna

330
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.300
Evan Woollacott: this is what we're gonna do. Let me just show you

331
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.740
Evan Woollacott: we're gonna steam this week. It's only Wednesday,

332
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.660
Evan Woollacott: so we're gonna build them some slides.

333
00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:04.320
Evan Woollacott: And we we set a conversation with Dolan

334
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:12.360
Evan Woollacott: and some others that are on his team, and some others who weren't. And what sort of bubbled up

335
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.729
Evan Woollacott: is. There's like 2 actions that need to occur here for this go to market plan.

336
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.200
Evan Woollacott: There's the near term move where

337
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:32.629
Evan Woollacott: there's existing sales, levers that can be bent. Quote unquote bent to service the needs of Smb, so there's like a partner lever, that's 20%. And you could

338
00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:45.000
Evan Woollacott: like adjust it. So it's more maximal maximize its effect in smb, so basically, what that allows Dolan to do is he doesn't need to get approvals, but he can like jigger it, so to speak.

339
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:54.079
Evan Woollacott: And now it's a new lever, but it's really just a tie into an existing one, because otherwise you need like executive approval. Blah, blah blah blah to do anything.

340
00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:04.699
Evan Woollacott: So there's gonna be a Band-aid response, but that allows for speed and agility to respond basically to what what we're seeing to give sales some help down market.

341
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.260
Evan Woollacott: But, as we know.

342
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:18.679
Evan Woollacott: a half measure is not enough to deal with what we're seeing like. Our competitors are all taking full measures already to attack us and blow us up. We're responding with Band-aids.

343
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.800
Evan Woollacott: So we need to do more.

344
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:28.309
Evan Woollacott: But like we need, you can't. Just. We can't figure out what we need to do in a week like we. That's a large problem to solve.

345
00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:54.909
Evan Woollacott: And so like, that's kind of like what the it's like long term, we need to do more. But we need to like, do our due diligence before we just say what we need like? It needs to be a new package. Probably there needs to like a college essentials bundle, or something like that, or there needs to be like beat. Nice. Beat 5, 9. Beat Amazon Smb plays that they can use that. Maybe there's a larger discounting

346
00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:02.020
Evan Woollacott: threshold, whatever it might be, or there's Tsd support like there's all sorts of things that will go into that right? So it's it's not just one thing.

347
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.659
Evan Woollacott: And so we're building a slide to kind of

348
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:18.419
Evan Woollacott: put that out based off like, that's our recommendation, almost like from the competitive market. What we're seeing. We're getting our asses handed to us. We need to do something rapidly. And then we also need to think through this logically long term.

349
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:35.039
Evan Woollacott: and I've already texted this sort of theory, or whatever belief to Az, and he's like, I agree completely. Cause on the call. I didn't want to say it out loud, because I don't want to get out of my skis and lob a grenade into this meeting. Be like, yeah, this isn't yeah. It's good, but not good enough.

350
00:33:36.187 --> 00:33:52.239
Evan Woollacott: And he he's like, next time, just love it like, I'll take the heat. Because I think you're right. Basically. So we're so that's a long context. I just want to give you context. We're gonna we're building this slide now, this deck. Sorry deck. We'll call it 3 to 5 slide deck.

351
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.810
Evan Woollacott: We'll have this sort of executive summary view, and I've modified the competitive recap

352
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:06.260
Evan Woollacott: where it was before. It was like trend recommendation. Ci action. But now it's like trend need recommendation.

353
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.670
Evan Woollacott: And so.

354
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.170
Matt Coblentz: Can kind of follow the logic. There.

355
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.850
Evan Woollacott: And then.

356
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:18.650
Evan Woollacott: as we keep hearing, we need to quantify the pain whatever that means. So how we're gonna quantify that pain.

357
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:28.049
Evan Woollacott: We're gonna show the competitive Gcv count win rates. For this is just commercial, obviously for Genesis. Nice Amazon. 5, 9.

358
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.859
Evan Woollacott: Vanessa wanted quarterly views. But it's kind of hard cause. It's it's so wonky like Amazon.

359
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.480
Matt Coblentz: Very lumpy.

360
00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:46.579
Evan Woollacott: q, 1 will be like 25%, and then in Q, 2 will be like 80, and then Q 3, it'll be 0, cause like there's no deals. So I settled on yearly, because I think it's better representation.

361
00:34:47.603 --> 00:34:48.509
Evan Woollacott: But yes.

362
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.480
Matt Coblentz: We could do. Yeah, we could do it. Yeah, when basically, it's a trailing.

363
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.110
Matt Coblentz: You know, Allison.

364
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.570
Evan Woollacott: You could do at 2 Pm.

365
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:04.079
Evan Woollacott: I guess we could do that if we wanted, but I'd have to go rebuild it, and I'd rather see. Get

366
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:14.659
Evan Woollacott: Az reaction first, st and then we if you want. We can do that. But I thought about Ttm, but I don't like Ttm, because it's like you're diluted. I don't know. I I see what you're saying, you know.

367
00:35:16.127 --> 00:35:17.919
Evan Woollacott: So this is helpful.

368
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.260
Matt Coblentz: Whether or not our stuff is having an impact, though. So that's actually why.

369
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.210
Evan Woollacott: Yeah,

370
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:33.419
Evan Woollacott: so sorry. Quantify the pain by just showing the win rates so that there's knowledge there. We know that they're talking a lot about win rates already. So this is to help Az.

371
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:44.120
Evan Woollacott: Next is your slot of just all I did was make it meter. I just think this is so hard to look at, but it's all your text. It's all your text. Still.

372
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:44.910
Matt Coblentz: I'm fine.

373
00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.749
Evan Woollacott: I need a I'm probably gonna use chat to be Ti gotta try to trim this

374
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.630
Evan Woollacott: cause. I don't. It's super dense.

375
00:35:56.546 --> 00:36:01.289
Matt Coblentz: So I originally had something that was much shorter, and Vanessa made me make it.

376
00:36:02.778 --> 00:36:08.149
Matt Coblentz: She wanted it into pillars like 3 to 5 pillars each, and I'm like, Oh, my God! So.

377
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.340
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

378
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:22.019
Matt Coblentz: The mean we can before you go crazy, you know. Let's just figure out what people like.

379
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:27.489
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, well, and I also wouldn't mind showing this to easy and getting his.

380
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.510
Matt Coblentz: Oh, exactly!

381
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:49.740
Evan Woollacott: And then like, if he's like, can we just trim it? Then it's like, Okay, let's go. Trim versus is the content fine the contents fine. Then why are we? Let's stop spinning on it. Basically the only one I do need to trim these 2 just so that they don't go over, but I can just use like Ampersand, and take out words here or there.

382
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.090
Matt Coblentz: Oh, yeah, we can do all kinds of things, including acronyms and.

383
00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:01.709
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, like this one building an affordability. Now, key to winning.

384
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.029
Evan Woollacott: There, that's done.

385
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.120
Matt Coblentz: Yep.

386
00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.669
Evan Woollacott: And then. So after that.

387
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:19.660
Evan Woollacott: it's this is supposed to be Vanessa working on it, but I don't see any effort yet, but.

388
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.730
Matt Coblentz: Alright!

389
00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.569
Evan Woollacott: It's like tangible examples. So

390
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:37.920
Evan Woollacott: my recommendation was to do. She organized it backwards. But I was thinking, you just do like nice Amazon, 5, 9 others, and it would be like.

391
00:37:38.972 --> 00:37:54.649
Evan Woollacott: Known or pricing and packing discounts, Ps, and like implementation discounts targeted campaigns or something. And then logo examples where we can hyperlink to pay fit blah blah blah.

392
00:37:55.210 --> 00:38:16.389
Evan Woollacott: because then it's evidence of what we're saying, and it's proving that they're going far further than us on their discounts, even with. So our repurposing of existing levers is not gonna be enough, because, like the point is, it's not just responding to them. But it's making ourselves more appealing than them. And we are coming up short of that. We know already.

393
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.975
Evan Woollacott: They're doing 90% discounts. We're doing 20.

394
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.500
Evan Woollacott: So that's the current state.

395
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.449
Matt Coblentz: 5 with that for long, though.

396
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:27.640
Evan Woollacott: What's that?

397
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.839
Matt Coblentz: I don't see how they survive that way for long, though you know what I mean.

398
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.380
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I mean, well, the interesting.

399
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:42.095
Evan Woollacott: This is why it takes like a lot. It's more than just thinking of an idea. But like, if you think about easy, send the call his

400
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:49.881
Evan Woollacott: their expansion average acv deal is like 60 k. Or something, and he's like it's time it's peanuts. But

401
00:38:50.730 --> 00:39:00.799
Evan Woollacott: you rethink like our sales strategy where new Logos are 80% of his business. And he's getting clobbered in new logos because discounts. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:19.040
Evan Woollacott: if you stuff the hopper on one new Logos, and you're sacrificing whatever you're discounting here, you're giving free this or that. Whatever you're doing to sacrifice you're creating a bed of expansion opportunities for the long term, and he has shit expansion

403
00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:34.560
Evan Woollacott: performance, basically. But if he had twice the wins per quarter, I'm making up numbers but twice the wins per quarter. You're now jamming full this opportunity base to go do AI upselling, and digital whatever else you're going to be upselling

404
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:49.689
Evan Woollacott: which would make whatever discount you're doing now. Less painful long term. So it's near term. That's exactly what our competitors are doing. It's not like. It's a groundbreaking idea. But given how his business is organized. As it is, it's like a big opportunity.

405
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:56.619
Matt Coblentz: Right, this dashboard makes your point.

406
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.210
Matt Coblentz: So yeah, I mean.

407
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:09.340
Matt Coblentz: we're we get a lot of deals and pipeline and tech and financials. But all the other verticals suck.

408
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:15.100
Matt Coblentz: So, Genesis, you know, that's a Len Fisher problem there.

409
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:22.569
Matt Coblentz: and we gotta find something we can do about it. Now that said, I also know that Tara Mahoney's team, and you know

410
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.649
Matt Coblentz: the, you know, like the healthcare overlays under Chris Becker.

411
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.780
Matt Coblentz: they're way over subscribed. So we got shit. We gotta take care of.

412
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.240
Matt Coblentz: If we're trying to pump up the volume, we better be prepared to back it up, or

413
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.940
Matt Coblentz: the reps won't get the deals done.

414
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.590
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

415
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.990
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, alright.

416
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.640
Matt Coblentz: I'm down for this.

417
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:54.559
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I well, I told Vanessa I was like, let's just make a template here and tell

418
00:40:55.504 --> 00:40:57.720
Evan Woollacott: Jennifer Matt and Chinma.

419
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:11.270
Matt Coblentz: Jennifer, Jonathan Matt. And my, let's just start putting in, you know, like a 5, whatever you know, if there's a 5 9 displacement campaign. Talk about it. If there's a 5 9 Ps offering great, if there's nothing on pricing and packaging, skip it. That's okay.

420
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:16.140
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I don't know where she's at. I don't know what she's done

421
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:22.089
Evan Woollacott: but yeah, I mean, we started hear you, too. But.

422
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:27.099
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, that's kind of like what she what Chin Mai started there. So let's just we could repackage what she's got, and just.

423
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:35.680
Evan Woollacott: It's just a prettier layout of what was already done. So it's by competitor. So you can see and like whatever it would be like core license discounts.

424
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.560
Evan Woollacott: And like, you would just be like whatever 75%.

425
00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:42.690
Matt Coblentz: Yeah.

426
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.120
Evan Woollacott: Or above or whatever, and then

427
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:56.830
Evan Woollacott: rather than being like for pay, fit 75 for block. This, it's just like them examples over here. So if they people want to learn more, they can go to salesforce and go read the notes themselves.

428
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:03.749
Evan Woollacott: But that way it's just facts on a page as opposed to like a story, because we're telling the story upfront.

429
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.439
Evan Woollacott: This is just the evidence that we can link to.

430
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.119
Matt Coblentz: This works for me.

431
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.520
Evan Woollacott: There's 1.

432
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.240
Matt Coblentz: To slice it and dice it. But we can. You know I can work with this. So that's fine.

433
00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.450
Evan Woollacott: Are you doing nothing? Do you want to just do it?

434
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.880
Evan Woollacott: I don't know what she's, she said. She's gonna do it, but she hasn't done a single thing since we spoke. So I would just yeah.

435
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.740
Matt Coblentz: Vanessa.

436
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.630
Evan Woollacott: She says she's gonna build this view.

437
00:42:24.386 --> 00:42:25.200
Matt Coblentz: Not at.

438
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.820
Evan Woollacott: She did all this on the call

439
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.059
Evan Woollacott: my Rec. What I was gonna do.

440
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:34.158
Matt Coblentz: The woman is squirrelly right. I think she's overwhelmed with her stuff.

441
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.200
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

442
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.020
Matt Coblentz: Not good, not bad, just is. But she.

443
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.339
Evan Woollacott: If I were building it, though I would do this, I would do the vendors across the top.

444
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.929
Matt Coblentz: Give her something to chew on.

445
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.509
Evan Woollacott: I would do this.

446
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.559
Evan Woollacott: You do that across the top, and you can have, like an other over here.

447
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.120
Evan Woollacott: Oh, there!

448
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:05.760
Evan Woollacott: Other competitors, and like you could just if you wrote it something in like 50. You just be like put parentheses zoom

449
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:13.919
Evan Woollacott: and then do these fields on the left axis

450
00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.680
Evan Woollacott: like this. And then it's just an easy, digestible table

451
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:30.429
Evan Woollacott: like known losses, something like that. So you're like very basic. And then, once you've pretty this.

452
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.710
Evan Woollacott: you can populate for 5, 9, and then we can just

453
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:43.040
Evan Woollacott: comment, Chin Mai and Jennifer, can you please do this for aws and nice cause

454
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:50.679
Evan Woollacott: rather than me dig through what Jennifer's provided me in comments she could probably do it in 10 seconds. Is that is my where my brain's at.

455
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:59.610
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, particularly. I'll take a stab on the 5 9. 1. Right? Let me just, you know, work on that, and then then we can send it off to them because they'll get a sense of what it is we're trying to do.

456
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:03.689
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, do you? Wanna so you just you wanna build this. Then.

457
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.470
Matt Coblentz: Yeah.

458
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.059
Evan Woollacott: I would do we were, I was thinking, like licenses.

459
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:13.419
Evan Woollacott: discounts, and then, like Ps. etc, discounts.

460
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.209
Evan Woollacott: and then like known displacement campaigns, maybe.

461
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.860
Evan Woollacott: and that example and then known losses

462
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:31.819
Evan Woollacott: cause that way. It's like discounts from license discounts for Ps. What we if they have like a targeted campaign like a nice does a 5 9 does. Amazon doesn't. But they have like a broad approach.

463
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.710
Evan Woollacott: And then, whatever lost examples we have.

464
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.829
Matt Coblentz: We don't. Yeah. Amazon connect does not have a targeted campaign against us. They don't need to.

465
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.180
Evan Woollacott: No, they don't need to.

466
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.730
Matt Coblentz: Cool.

467
00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.359
Matt Coblentz: We're not that big a threat.

468
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.595
Evan Woollacott: Well, I'm glad I could just push this off from Vanessa on to you.

469
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.240
Matt Coblentz: But that's kind of the nature of it. Right.

470
00:44:57.693 --> 00:44:58.119
Evan Woollacott: I mean.

471
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.929
Matt Coblentz: And we'll give. We'll give her something that you want, and she'll probably re, you know, rearrange it. But at least she has something that she wants. You don't have to think.

472
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:10.119
Evan Woollacott: I just moved it for you. I I don't. These comments are these new comments?

473
00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.389
Evan Woollacott: 6, 3. What's the dates? The 4? th Right? All right? So they're old.

474
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:25.779
Evan Woollacott: I just put it on slide 5 for you, because the idea would be this slide, this slide, this slide, this slide, and then appendix, probably where he can take whatever he wants.

475
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.340
Matt Coblentz: Yeah.

476
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.300
Evan Woollacott: She's so funny. She's like, I want to get this to him by end of day. So I'll do this now.

477
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.916
Evan Woollacott: It's just something playing.

478
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.145
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

479
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:45.619
Matt Coblentz: Her road to hell is paid with her good intentions that come out of her mouth. That's okay, mine. I've done the exact same thing. So you know I feel for her.

480
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.830
Evan Woollacott: Feel for, but I also have some.

481
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:55.649
Matt Coblentz: She's holding this up right. She's gotta learn to let go of some things and delegate others, but she can't. She gotta also learn to slow down enough to explain it.

482
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.410
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, we were you one of my accelerate live call yesterday.

483
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:15.290
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, some of it. Oh, Casey's call. I was on the Casey call. Yeah. I didn't go into the next follow on commercial call, because after Amy, I stayed on because she's got a shit ton of rules that are coming down the pike for us. So

484
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:25.690
Matt Coblentz: watch out. It's actually it's actually to our benefit. So we know where the danger zones are. But it took her a while to go through it all.

485
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.510
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, we we talked about our one on one. She was apologizing again.

486
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:44.709
Evan Woollacott: She's like. I'm not trying to take you off it like I'm sorry if there are your feelings, or whatever I'm like. I don't. I don't care at all like I had no idea what was going on in that call.

487
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.109
Matt Coblentz: I just don't know what you need. I can't help.

488
00:46:47.110 --> 00:47:03.739
Evan Woollacott: Oh, you're right like you had a meeting with Jennifer and told Jennifer to lead it, and I've been on it from the gecko, and then I'm on this call, and Jennifer's like, I can't do the Pm. And I'm like, Wait, you're doing the Am. And then on the call somebody was like, so who's doing this? And I didn't say anything because I had no fucking idea. I was like.

489
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.330
Matt Coblentz: Me to do it.

490
00:47:06.793 --> 00:47:13.896
Evan Woollacott: Like I I didn't know what was going on, and then also I got signed up for a Cs. Then I didn't realize they're back to back.

491
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.760
Matt Coblentz: Oh, nice, I mean

492
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:21.149
Matt Coblentz: I'm on the West Coast, but she isn't asking me for anything. I will help Patrick, because he'll be on.

493
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:25.420
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I would if you should just take over for Patrick, because you're east West Coast.

494
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.000
Matt Coblentz: No? Well, I know why Patrick wants to do it, and

495
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:33.799
Matt Coblentz: right he wants to get into it. He needs a reason to actually be competent at it. Okay, fine.

496
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.579
Evan Woollacott: Which yeah, I mean, he'll do.

497
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.440
Matt Coblentz: All good.

498
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:43.310
Evan Woollacott: It is an easy presentation. It's not like it's an accelerate live where it's like. This is how you beat. But it's like this is the new tool.

499
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.969
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, right? And we'll be good at it. So

500
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.460
Matt Coblentz: it'd be great. I can always backstop him or answer questions. Live while he's talking.

501
00:47:53.300 --> 00:48:01.760
Evan Woollacott: And then she need imperative because we have that leadership call with Larry's team next week.

502
00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:06.840
Evan Woollacott: if you remember, on the team call, I was just like.

503
00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:15.989
Evan Woollacott: what are we presenting? Because, like I what we but and she's just like we're gonna do this that the other thing blah blah it was, and then she's

504
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.889
Evan Woollacott: I certainly hope not.

505
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.630
Evan Woollacott: But then we're presenting, I think, to Tony's team after that at the end of the month.

506
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:27.104
Evan Woollacott: and so I was just like like, what are we presenting?

507
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.599
Evan Woollacott: I don't know. We'll figure it out.

508
00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:34.640
Evan Woollacott: I don't know.

509
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:41.059
Matt Coblentz: Why, I mean in my mind it should just be

510
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:53.479
Matt Coblentz: a bunch of shit that we're it should be, you know, we're presenting to Tony's team on what we see. But how do we? I mean, we should be practicing that shit like we practice, inspire right.

511
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.699
Evan Woollacott: Oh, I know it was even Larry

512
00:48:56.678 --> 00:49:00.241
Evan Woollacott: meeting with Larry Dog, the L dog.

513
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:06.660
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, exactly.

514
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:16.100
Evan Woollacott: And I think part of like the calls to share, like the methodology and stuff, and that is not as boring conversation as I was like, how do I tell Larry

515
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:29.343
Evan Woollacott: how our win rates calculated, and how the plan on the page initiative was target was set using all the other like how that is a boring discussion that they're gonna be like eyes glazed immediately.

516
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.551
Evan Woollacott: What's the number? Y.

517
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:42.620
Matt Coblentz: Right. I mean, they want. They want a general description of the problem and your recommendation on it, you know, and be prepared to back up all of your shit with data and stuff like that.

518
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:51.490
Matt Coblentz: But sometimes they don't want it. I mean, they're if they feel the problem and they know it. They don't. You just validated their feelings. You're done.

519
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.480
Evan Woollacott: Right.

520
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.219
Matt Coblentz: If he already agrees with you, he won't ask for data.

521
00:49:58.890 --> 00:49:59.590
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

522
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:06.609
Matt Coblentz: Now, if you're saying something completely new, you better have your ducks, you know you better have your data lined up. But.

523
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:14.747
Evan Woollacott: Larry, you need to launch Genesis essentials for the the Smb. Market tomorrow. Who is this asshole?

524
00:50:15.451 --> 00:50:18.219
Matt Coblentz: Great idea what the fuck is an essential right? You didn't.

525
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:23.509
Evan Woollacott: Alright! Your bonus will cover the lost revenue. Thank you, Evan Willicott.

526
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.730
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, that could be entertaining.

527
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:27.470
Evan Woollacott: Yeah.

528
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:30.750
Matt Coblentz: Alright, I'm.

529
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.809
Evan Woollacott: Alpesh dude. Another Alpesh request. I love you, Alpesh, but you're starting to ask a lot.

530
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:45.300
Evan Woollacott: What's industry? Verticals? We don't have the verticals in our tableau data set. And he's like, Okay, well, any help you could provide would be great. I was like, I can't. There's nothing I could do.

531
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.590
Matt Coblentz: Right. Well, that's why I asked for that shit from Evan.

532
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.010
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I know.

533
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.979
Matt Coblentz: But you know not not quickly.

534
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:58.499
Matt Coblentz: you know I gotta build this other fucking slide for you. I'll take care of that, and then maybe.

535
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:04.790
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, I'm prioritizing stuff for easy over Alpesh in the second time. I've done it like I need to get stuff to easy. But.

536
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:11.799
Matt Coblentz: Yeah, and just tell alpash look, I don't think I can get to this for like another day and a half before I can start on it.

537
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.740
Matt Coblentz: and you know Matt will help me. But

538
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.700
Matt Coblentz: we got shit. We gotta do

539
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:27.110
Matt Coblentz: alright. I'm gonna go build this data, qual themes, slide 5 shit, and then I'm gonna go ask Chin Mai and Jennifer if I've done it. Well.

540
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.310
Evan Woollacott: Me!

541
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.859
Matt Coblentz: And we'll move along.

542
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.009
Evan Woollacott: Okay. So I'm just flying to Alpash. I'm not ignoring you, but thank you.

543
00:51:37.524 --> 00:51:39.170
Evan Woollacott: Let me know if you have.

544
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.639
Matt Coblentz: Help us!

545
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.035
Evan Woollacott: It's like, what.

546
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.350
Matt Coblentz: I said, we'll see how this goes.

547
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.051
Evan Woollacott: Yeah, no, I was saying, let me know if you have questions, but it's pretty straightforward.

548
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.490
Matt Coblentz: Questions every freaking day but this one I think I understand.

549
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.559
Matt Coblentz: Alright! I will talk with you soon.

550
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.350
Evan Woollacott: Alright. Thank you.

551
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.080
Matt Coblentz: Later.
